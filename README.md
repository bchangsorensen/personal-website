This is the repo for my personal website, which I build using [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and George Cushen's [Academic theme for Hugo](https://wowchemy.com/). When customizing the look and feel of my site, I drew inspiration from the personal websites built by [Isabella Benabaye](https://www.isabella-b.com/) and [Connor Rothschild](https://www.connorrothschild.com/). Check them out!
