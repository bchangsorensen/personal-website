title: Hi! I'm Benjamin.

I'm a progressive data analyst in Baltimore, and I currently work as the data director for {{< hl >}}The Collective{{< /hl >}}, a group of organizations dedicated to building Black political power across America. I grew up in Palo Alto before heading down the road to {{< hl >}}Stanford University{{< /hl >}} for undergrad, where I studied political science, statistics, and history. I wrote an honors thesis about leaks as disinformation, centered on an online experiment I designed and implemented in my senior year. 

After graduating in 2018, I joined the {{< hl >}}Nevada State Democratic Party's{{< /hl >}} coordinated campaign as a data associate, and was promoted to deputy data director that fall. I got hooked on electoral politics in Nevada: there's something about the people you meet and work with on campaigns that can't be beat. There's also something to be said about winning in Las Vegas.

After the election, I moved to Seattle for an exciting new challenge at {{< hl >}}Adaptive Biotechnologies{{< /hl >}}. I joined a small team focused on building out the company's business intelligence operation, and learned a lot about dashboarding and data modeling, and a little bit about T-cells and B-cells. During my spare time I fell in love with the city of Seattle and had the privilege to work part-time for {{< hl >}}Shaun Scott's city council campaign{{< /hl >}} in district four, where we fought for a municipal Green New Deal and an end to racist policing. 

In June of 2020 I decided to jump back into politics full-time with the {{< hl >}}Montana Democratic Party{{< /hl >}} in Helena. It wasn't an easy decision to leave Adaptive and move to a new state on short notice, but I couldn't pass up the chance to finally retake the Senate and knew that I had to be in the fight. We fell short in the end, but along the way I learned more than I could have imagined about organizing and campaigning, and I'm extremely proud of the program our data team put together. Montana also spoiled me, and some of my best memories are from the few days I got to steal away to go backpacking, camping, kayaking, or snowshoeing (pictured above). 

I love to work in R and the Tidyverse, a preference I picked up in Stanford's [Data Challenge Lab](https://dcl-docs.stanford.edu/home/) and which I'll probably never kick thanks to all the cool packages being developed by the R community (like `blogdown`, which helped me build this site). Outside of R I've worked extensively in SQL, Tableau, Sheets, and a bunch of campaign technologies like VoteBuilder and Civis. In the fall of 2021, I joined the inaugural cohort of the [Analytics Engineers Club](https://analyticsengineers.club/), which helped me formalize my knowledge of analytics engineering and get practical experience with tools like `dbt` and `git`.

Lastly, I'm motivated by the issues that are most important to me: tackling the climate crisis, fixing our broken democracy, and fighting racial injustice. I'm also motivated by organizers and activists -- people in the fight -- and I believe that together we can make some progress and change some minds.
