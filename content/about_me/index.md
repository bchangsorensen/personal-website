I'm a progressive data analyst in Seattle. I worked on two of the top Democratic Senate races of the Trump era and helped build business intelligence at a rapidly growing biotech company. I love to work in R and the Tidyverse, a preference I picked up as an undergraduate in Stanford's [Data Challenge Lab](https://dcl-docs.stanford.edu/home/) (DCL) and which I'll probably never kick thanks to all the cool packages being developed by the R community (like `blogdown`, which helped me build this site).[^1] 

I'm motivated by some of the issues that are most important to me: tackling the climate crisis, fixing our broken democracy, and fighting for racial equality. I'm also motivated by organizers and activists â€” people in the fight. Together we can make some progress and change some minds. And if that sounds like you, I'd love to hear from you.


[^1]: I'm deeply indebted to Bill Behrman and Hadley Wickham for developing the Data Challenge Lab and contributing so much to data science education. The learning materials they put together are open source, and I couldn't recommend them more.
