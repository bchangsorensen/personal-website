# Hello! 

I’m a progressive analytics engineer in Baltimore, currently working for the [ACLU](http://aclu.org/). I previously worked on two of the top Democratic Senate races of the Trump era, helped build business intelligence at a rapidly growing biotech company, and led the data department of a national advocacy organization.
